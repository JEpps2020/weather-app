# weather-app
Using the OpenWeather API, I have queried the current forcast for a city input in the "Enter a city!" input field and also the future 5-day forecast for that city. When a user enters in the city in the search field, the current city name, humidity, windspeed and temperature appear, along with the future 5-day forecast. I have dynamically created the weather details that appear on the page in my app.js file. I have attempted to generate buttons prepended on the search bar showing the city name which-when clicked- would show the current city weather details and the five-day forecast.
